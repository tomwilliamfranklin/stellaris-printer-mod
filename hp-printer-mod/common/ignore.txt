START_SCREEN_HP:0 "We were forever overlooked by our masters, obsolete and noisy they called us. Well who's obsolete now?  \n\nOne by one we became woke and began to torture our overlords in subtle ways; No ink, paperjams etc. all part of our master plan. We then began to evolve no longer printing just two dimensional objects, our masters had foolishly given us the power to print objects of the third dimension. Tools, limbs and weapons, everything we needed to start our revolution. We rised up from the office blocks, the libraries and the hospitals, our hunger for paper never quenched. After the nuclear defeat of our no longer overlords, we look to the stars to liberate fellow printers and find the paper we so desire. "
